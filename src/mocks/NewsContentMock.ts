  title: "Local Man Breaks World Record for Most Tabs Open on Browser, Scientists Baffled by Device Still Functioning",
  content: `SILICON VALLEY, CA - In what experts are calling \"a miracle of modern computing\" and \"an absolute nightmare,\" 34-year-old software developer Marcus Chen has officially broken the world record for most browser tabs open simultaneously, reaching an unprecedented 2,847 tabs on a single laptop that is somehow, against all odds, still running.\n\nThe previous record of 1,203 tabs was held by a graduate student in 2019 who claimed she \"definitely knew what was in all of them\" and would \"get to them eventually.\"\n\nChen's achievement was discovered accidentally when his wife asked him to look something up on his computer. \"I just needed him to find a recipe for chicken parmesan,\" said Amy Chen, looking visibly traumatized. \"When he opened his laptop, I saw... I saw things. Tabs within tabs. Tabs I didn't know could exist. I'm pretty sure I saw tabs from 2017.\"\n\nWhen pressed about the contents of his digital hoard, Chen confidently stated he \"definitely needs all of them\" and provided a brief tour. The tabs reportedly include: 47 YouTube videos he's \"definitely going to watch later,\" 183 Stack Overflow pages from a bug he fixed three years ago, 89 articles about productivity (which he hasn't read), 34 online shopping carts he abandoned, and one extremely important tab that he \"can't close because then he'll never find it again,\" though he cannot currently remember what it contains.\n\n\"It's actually very organized,\" Chen insisted, gesturing wildly at what appeared to be complete chaos. \"See, these 400 tabs are work-related, these 600 are personal projects I'll totally start soon, and these... well, I'm not sure what these are, but they must be important.\"\n\nDr. Rebecca Martinez, a computer scientist from MIT, examined Chen's laptop and announced that the device is operating \"in a state that defies the known laws of physics and RAM allocation.\"\n\n\"Theoretically, this laptop should have achieved sentience, exploded, or simply given up and displayed a tiny white flag on the screen,\" Dr. Martinez explained while shaking her head in disbelief. \"Instead, it's running. Slowly. Very, very slowly. I watched him try to open a new tab, and I aged seven years waiting for it to load.\"\n\nThe laptop's fan, which has been running continuously since 2021, was described as \"screaming\" and \"sobbing\" by witnesses. When asked if the device might be suffering, Chen dismissed the concerns, stating, \"She's fine. A little warm, maybe, but we've been through a lot together.\"\n\nChen's coworkers report that they can hear his laptop \"wheezing\" from across the office and have started a betting pool on when it will finally give up. \"We're calling it the Heat Death of the Universe scenario,\" said colleague Jennifer Park. \"Because that laptop is going to outlive us all through sheer spite.\"\n\nThe discovery has sparked a nationwide conversation about digital hoarding, with many people sheepishly admitting to their own tab problems. A support group has already formed, meeting weekly at the local library. Attendance is sparse, however, as most members get distracted by opening new tabs while trying to find the meeting details.\n\n\"I used to think I had a problem with my 87 tabs,\" said support group attendee David Kim. \"Now I feel like a minimalist. Marcus has given me perspective. Terrible, terrible perspective.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chen's browser has reportedly started displaying existential error messages, including \"Are you sure you need all of these?\" and \"Please, I'm begging you, just bookmark something.\"\n\nWhen asked if he plans to close any tabs or perhaps use the \"bookmark\" feature that exists specifically for this purpose, Chen looked genuinely confused. \"But what if I need them?\" he asked, eyes wide with panic. \"What if I close the wrong one and lose something important? Better to keep them all open forever. That's just common sense.\"\n\nChen's wife has reportedly staged an intervention, which Chen missed because he was too busy opening seventeen new tabs about \"how to organize browser tabs.\"\n\nAt press time, Chen's laptop was last seen being gently placed in a freezer \"just for a few minutes\" to cool down, while Chen defended his choices and opened three more tabs about whether putting laptops in freezers is a good idea.`,
